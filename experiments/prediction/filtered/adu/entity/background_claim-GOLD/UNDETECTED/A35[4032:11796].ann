T5d6870d042849304cf9fa71fe9fffe11	background_claim-GOLD 509 778	The simulation context, which can either be an extensive computation of the motion along time requiring accurate evaluation of all the dynamical factors, or a simple relaxation process where the simulation has to converge to the static rest state as quickly as possible
T560075b5ed063fa3d779fb9c3df4d67f	background_claim-GOLD 782 1076	The stiffness of the problem, mainly related to the rigidity of the particle interactions and the size of the chosen time step, which translated into the “difficulty” the numerical method has to compute the evolution numerically, and which practically causes inaccuracy and instability problems
T72479f246ffe63aec47cd4edee8f5a9e	background_claim-GOLD 1080 1160	The time an iteration takes to compute, and the number of mechanical derivations
T43539ad6b9b9860a1002f30f5735bdeb	background_claim-GOLD 1416 1686	One can easily turn the second-order systems relating dynamical mechanical systems into first-order systems by constructing a state vector defined by the concatenation of position and speed states of the system, such as to fit the requirements of any of these algorithms
