T17b14996012313c58cf5936ea7b73b56	own_claim-GOLD 1375 1473	There is an obvious advantage of using implicit methods, and particularly the inverse Euler method

T920956cafb86ff153e1c54b1d0d2c850	own_claim-GOLD 2111 2233	Their stability gives a false sense of efficiency, allowing obtaining quickly a result by “cheating” on the time step size

Tee99fc38847e2d1121202c14097a1bb5	own_claim-GOLD 3367 3593	The explicit methods have still their interest, and should be reserved for simulations requiring high accuracy and particularly those where involving low mechanical damping and where mechanical energy conservation is important
