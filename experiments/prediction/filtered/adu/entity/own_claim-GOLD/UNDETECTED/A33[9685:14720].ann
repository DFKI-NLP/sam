T305705df46345e1aa303366bcc9d2678	own_claim-GOLD 455 525	we need markers that are both small in scale and highly discriminative
Td4a178dd68a549694349f2b23079363f	own_claim-GOLD 1345 1477	we adopt the following strategy: maximize information obtained from marker color and eliminate the information needed from neighbors
Ta0f1ebaf32716fb0433f0516cbdfee7e	own_claim-GOLD 1693 1796	we can accurately minimize the number of neighbors required for correspondence and observe folds better
T30a61ec189438ac8ac8458c6991829ba	own_claim-GOLD 1798 1862	We can compare our work to previous methods using this framework
Tea091320997c95c2a55a147616393596	own_claim-GOLD 2292 2334;2345 2527	we compute our information budget (I ) as: N = number of observed neighbors C = color information per marker A = information lost to structural ambiguities S = information gained from strain constraints I = (N + 1) ∗C + S − A
