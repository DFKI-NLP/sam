Tb0109718203aa318107a1d539dc4972f	own_claim-GOLD 126 282	We accomplish this through an iterative algorithm where we alternate between computing correspondence and pruning bad matches based on those correspondences
Tb96eefe3d480df4b2b90577bb0e3154a	own_claim-GOLD 2886 2987	This approach works from flat regions in the first iteration to foldy regions in the later iterations
T0b58a74ecc25da1c6103f776cf4275a6	own_claim-GOLD 3251 3277	no neighbors are necessary
Te78faa40a33faef040f1053b620fe777	own_claim-GOLD 3279 3297	Occluding contours
Tfa60b01ee1b291e9f7571e068da73d99	own_claim-GOLD 3343 3383	no longer disrupt the matching procedure
