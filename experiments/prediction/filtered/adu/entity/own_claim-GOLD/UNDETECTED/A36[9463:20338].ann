Tc0e897c12c39559237774fe33b6e2738	own_claim-GOLD 341 377	we focus primarily on tensile forces
T7150dbca6ad1b2bf8ca04e9bfc0df284	own_claim-GOLD 3299 3471	The raw data for a single deformation consists of 20 to 200 individual measurement frames, with a set of camera images and simultaneous force sensor readings for each frame
Td32b6e3bb01ff92f1320839ba1a69827	own_claim-GOLD 3973 4132	To represent inter-frame correspondence, we use optical flow to obtain a single triangle mesh that deforms over time, akin to the human face tracking method of
T6deeaa8f7d200e9d56add3fbe54c563b	own_claim-GOLD 4338 4456	Back-projecting onto the reconstructed geometry for the next frame gives new position estimates for the cloth vertices
T0f8af0e202ecc1f09c5699c1505ef9e3	own_claim-GOLD 4672 4794	To avoid drift, we subsequently match each frame independently back to the rest pose frame using the approach described in

T7969371f040d884bdd22fab517d01882	own_claim-GOLD 5248 5368	The area of cloth occluded by the clips is used to automatically determine which cloth vertices are clamped by each clip

T5a681ac9e7d83a4f9780b0da374475cc	own_claim-GOLD 5427 5520	The vision system also finds the cords in the images and triangulates a 3D line for each cord

T3db02ae980e73b2123eb37bdc4a030cc	own_claim-GOLD 7565 7806	To reduce the risk of falling into local minima during parameter fits, we have designed deformation sequences that produce near-isolated strains, and allow estimating stretch, shear and bending properties in a separate and incremental manner
