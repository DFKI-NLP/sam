T9d7a36fee92b77487e0025d890d2f5c1	data-GOLD 2009 2247	For both types of collisions, our detection algorithm reports an intersection, and then takes action to remedy the situation: either by enforcing a constraint (cloth/solid collisions) or by adding a penalty force (cloth/cloth) collisions.

T7f9f3b703f9c312349264a415cfac25f	data-GOLD 2711 2887	we simply enforce a constraint which causes the colliding cloth particle to have a velocity consistent with the solid objectâ€™s velocity, and continue to enforce that constraint
Tdde71ccc420dcf049973e1d6f9fe3917	data-GOLD 3512 3756	when intersections occurred, rather than wait for a scheduled constraint or a penalty force to eliminate the intersection, we simply altered the positions of the cloth particles, effecting an instantaneous (and discontinuous) change in position
