T778eb010694493146c4e26d2d3edbbdc	data-GOLD 787 937	Using the stiffness parameters in figure 1 as a reference, we ran the simulation with those bend stiffnesses multiplied by 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100 and 1,000
T6e4a599c51d53b320131f76fec351cab	data-GOLD 1234 1350	We ran the simulation in figure 1 with cloth resolutions of 500, 899, 2,602 (shown in figure 1 ) and 7,359 particles
Tee89751670fae7f529f996c6a0bc4123	data-GOLD 1352 1472	The running times were, respectively, 0.23 seconds/frame, 0.46 seconds/frame, 2.23 seconds/frame, and 10.3 seconds/frame
