<H1>7. Conclusion</H1>
        This paper has demonstrated a novel system for observing cloth behavior, including complete information about deformation and forces, and a new method for fitting and evaluating cloth models using the measurements. Our system is different from standard textile testing systems because it captures detailed geometry information; it is different from previous cloth capture systems in that it captures complete force information and measures deformations of a 3D surface. The combination of very complete position and force information provides an unprecedented view into the complex behavior of cloth. Our measurement setup offers very accurate control over membrane deformations, but the bending tests require manual intervention and are thus less precise. Furthermore, the bending tests are most accurate for samples with straight edges, but some cloth materials (in particular knit) tend to curl up at free boundaries. In order to eliminate these problems, we would like to investigate alternative ways of controlling bending deformations in the future. The data from our experiments shows some of the limitations of current models. The most obvious of these is hysteresis—all widely used cloth models are elastic, but cloth is clearly far from elastic, resulting in quite large errors for any given point in the experiment. There are many paths for future work in measurement, including more complete exploration of strain space (including compression) and capture of dynamic properties, and in fitting, where new ways of evaluating fitting error are needed that can work when the cloth’s equilibrium state is unstable or non-deterministic.
