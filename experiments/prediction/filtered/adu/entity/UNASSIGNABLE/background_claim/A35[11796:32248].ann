T613e10ddacf27295bf08ae7ce0305b90	background_claim 15654 15733	the strain-stress relation describing elasticity may actually be complex curves
Tada8d832cfa746e0ece5f186e1e3c9f9	background_claim 15817 15889	During the simulation, the orientation of the mechanical elements change
T5394abf8bf3e2af54ab8d1c999daee19	background_claim 15895 15972	this modifies the expressions of the mechanical laws in the world coordinates

T6e74aff117a02e937e15a004ec00b6d4	background_claim 16042 16160	nonlinearity may disrupt the stability of simulations integrated with implicit models with large disturbing vibrations
T65dec6ca4fd8c16b4b79ae2ecdd93225	background_claim 16449 16644	The reason for that is that the hypothetical equilibrium state is derived from the knowledge of the Hessian matrix, which relates the firstorder evolution of the forces as the deformations change
Te56fcc61e6bab1a3a200ba5eefb442db	background_claim 16646 16721	Nonlinearity causes this matrix to change between the successive iterations
