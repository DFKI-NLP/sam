T9d6b3be5978a61b5a4415ced6f815b15	own_claim 1141 1239	The number of iterations should also be set sensitively to the stiffness of the mechanical problem
Tca9b36661ec05d90287dbdb017e1c732	own_claim 1375 1430	There is an obvious advantage of using implicit methods
Tbd1d9a53b8ec878e8362ad85a5066f14	own_claim 1585 1700	the inverse Euler method allow to perform a draping problem almost ten times as fast as with the Runge-Kutta method
T6b71b5466a4074e963fca22e8590bd9f	own_claim 1708 1848	not exactly reproducing real mechanical behavior, the simulation with large time steps provides a quite efficient convergence to equilibrium
T162773f8810542965fb7c3fbfb40e798	own_claim 1854 1907	the numerical errors quite often act as extra damping
T90493182f3698ff252b6ffe4bce2fc0f	own_claim 1909 1965	removing the need of adding them explicitly to the model
Td6351d0eba178659740cb0fcd34ed1aa	own_claim 2111 2160	Their stability gives a false sense of efficiency
T900983da924476f82dea2b3d3da8cebb	own_claim 2162 2233	allowing obtaining quickly a result by “cheating” on the time step size
T284c171bb1cb0a9c0efbbc3886edf39a	own_claim 2435 2519	These artifacts are still augmented by the approximations made to the Hessian matrix
T7b578c7188bc769739390198b31e0d58	own_claim 2685 2816	It seems that there is still some benefit in using the Backward Euler method than any other explicit method for dynamic simulations
Tc6d692039a237defa26050d1a4ebf867	own_claim 3367 3539	The explicit methods have still their interest, and should be reserved for simulations requiring high accuracy and particularly those where involving low mechanical damping
T34cbf3e327a1ed8f0a8eb5e2ae766c7a	own_claim 4754 4840	We intend to pursue our investigations for dealing with damping in a more accurate way
