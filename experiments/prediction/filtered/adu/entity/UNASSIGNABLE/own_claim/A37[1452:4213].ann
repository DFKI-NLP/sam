T4cf260bb0c5cbe8c82dde2516d870834	own_claim 37 91	Our eyes are very sensitive to the behavior of fabrics
Ta05803c52873318b14d21a646fac1672	own_claim 112 179	we can identify the kind of fabric simply from its shape and motion
T3bdf55cbe5d3eef062aadd1d1ecf2e75	own_claim 948 1105	We present numerical evidence supporting the observation that a constraint-based method is inherently well-suited to operate in the quasi-inextensible regime
T7e128ac0ca96f8f03a3a4d377c7591e0	own_claim 1309 1340	We are motivated by the work of
T4f84c4005ca0aa58f73d6b92fa84eff6	own_claim 1365 1436	who viewed strain limiting as one of multiple velocity filtering passes
T0df318feaff1436c5bb4445491adf115	own_claim 1663 1711	many simulation methods allow 10% or more strain
Tceafcd77a2bc6692c2b93d840c2e45b0	own_claim 1721 1756	many fabrics do not visibly stretch
T4a093d50d2446c8249ea5df074074e37	own_claim 2090 2168	the implicit methodâ€™s nonlinear equations correspond to a minimization problem
Tfc14ca301549558242155fe1a0674603	own_claim 2262 2443	We describe an implementation of fast projection as a simple and efficient velocity filter, as part of a framework that decouples timestepping, inextensibility, and collision passes
