T088e298ee90b963dc0d53b60bc5db8e3	own_claim 2280 2514	This result is consistent with our intuition that static tests cannot be used to estimate dynamic parameters like stretch and shear damping or air drag and motivates the waving test, which excites both the static and waving parameters
T6a48ed09851a1c332fd33a403c1a6a9e	own_claim 3528 3623	5 This approach seems to produce plausible results with skirts and other validation experiments
T3b225825269d4f94b64e2568996f1835	own_claim 3650 3800	a more general solution for parameter identification using our framework is to simultaneously optimize across multiple trials of different experiments
