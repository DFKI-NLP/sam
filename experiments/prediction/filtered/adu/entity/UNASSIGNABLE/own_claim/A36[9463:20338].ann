T408dd723606d0fc5ba67858e7b620a25	own_claim 39 305	The design goals of our measurement system are to create deformations in a sample of cloth that explore a substantial range of the materialâ€™s strain space, and to record complete information about the forces applied to the cloth and the deformation that it undergoes
T2e39da922e5446ed5dbca42dfefb4795	own_claim 307 377	Like other cloth testing systems, we focus primarily on tensile forces
Td51046bc55b449ab0a79e45c402ddbd3	own_claim 3973 4089	To represent inter-frame correspondence, we use optical flow to obtain a single triangle mesh that deforms over time
T16a91dbf196d5aa6d9469fed33aa2806	own_claim 4540 4579	As with all sequential tracking methods
Tf210a375dd8e033de07e3688128f216e	own_claim 4925 5084	In order to measure the complete answer that a simulator should predict, we need to determine the interaction between the rigid clips, the cloth, and the cords
T21a0f0908b97c33dce217d6377cd14ce	own_claim 7404 7563	to fit model parameters for stretch, shear and bending that best describe the cloth, and to validate the parameter fits by comparing against other measurements
T7ff371cfed010e1193c8931e5f93de64	own_claim 7565 7709	To reduce the risk of falling into local minima during parameter fits, we have designed deformation sequences that produce near-isolated strains
T70369a5f258cb6321c59bdbf2346523e	own_claim 7715 7806	allow estimating stretch, shear and bending properties in a separate and incremental manner
T19d1a83795412a12d9130673c92d6246	own_claim 7817 7861	unlike standard textile evaluation practices
Tb8e7e6a1a74d324b268b196f222d340d	own_claim 7876 7971	thanks to our full 3D deformation capture solution, we relax the requirement of uniform strains
T200cacf609ae26d291165a1bad9afed4	own_claim 8322 8388	Shearing is captured using an approximate picture-frame experiment
T20a63e8b2b2b9296ec7c9c3ac2a512d8	own_claim 10096 10227	In the vision system, the camera calibration accuracy is within 0.3 pixels, or about 0.075 millimeters at the distance of the cloth
