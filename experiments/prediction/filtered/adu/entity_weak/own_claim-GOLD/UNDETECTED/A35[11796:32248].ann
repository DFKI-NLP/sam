T0f7827415442772fc158949bf7b95e6a	own_claim-GOLD 3524 3777	For measuring accuracy and numerical stability of the algorithms, we need to set up a “standard” material on which the experiments are carried out, as well as the rules allowing to extrapolate the results to any material of different size and parameters
Tcb4c7c3b9b9ca66ae91eda53948eb10b	own_claim-GOLD 4152 4511	Thanks to the linearity of the equations describing linear elasticity, we reduce the number of parameters describing a problem using proportionality laws, and we compute a “condition coefficient” K which illustrates the acceleration of a mesh element with normalization to the problem mass, simulation time step and element size, as follows: K = E d 1 l 2 t 2
T1fda920fdee4d676f663016552aea0b8	own_claim-GOLD 6278 6444	we perform a preconditioning of the system state variables of the linear system to be resolved using the inverse square root of the mass of the corresponding particle
