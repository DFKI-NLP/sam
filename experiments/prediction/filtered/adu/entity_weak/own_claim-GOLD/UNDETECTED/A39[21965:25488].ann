Tc77123c6173973cc4b1711c7c26805d7	own_claim-GOLD 281 358	we must first transform equation (2) into a first-order differential equation
Te5dcef099df41e5a8fe5bd38db3a7676	own_claim-GOLD 2521 2678	the backward Euler step consists of evaluating f 0 , ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂v; forming the system in equation (6); solving the system for v; and then updating x and v
Te79d236ffb72b98ad80878a90e4378b9	own_claim-GOLD 2901 2938	The method is called “backward” Euler
