T7150dbca6ad1b2bf8ca04e9bfc0df284	own_claim-GOLD 3299 3471	The raw data for a single deformation consists of 20 to 200 individual measurement frames, with a set of camera images and simultaneous force sensor readings for each frame
T6deeaa8f7d200e9d56add3fbe54c563b	own_claim-GOLD 4338 4456	Back-projecting onto the reconstructed geometry for the next frame gives new position estimates for the cloth vertices
T0f8af0e202ecc1f09c5699c1505ef9e3	own_claim-GOLD 4672 4794	To avoid drift, we subsequently match each frame independently back to the rest pose frame using the approach described in
T7969371f040d884bdd22fab517d01882	own_claim-GOLD 5248 5368	The area of cloth occluded by the clips is used to automatically determine which cloth vertices are clamped by each clip
