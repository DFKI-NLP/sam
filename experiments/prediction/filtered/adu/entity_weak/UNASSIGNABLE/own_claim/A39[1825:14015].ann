T080da8c0508e8beffee2697ea2e4143a	own_claim 3627 3841	We describe a simulation system that uses a triangular mesh for cloth surfaces, eliminating topological restrictions of rectangular meshes, and a simple but versatile formulation of the internal cloth energy forces
Tc503d59e987ac42cc158d104aa0749d6	own_claim 3844 3892	Unlike previous metric-tensor-based formulations
T1e2c076e4063afb2f00412bee53318b0	own_claim 3989 4074	we model deformation energies only as quadratic functions with suitably large scaling
T8a5ff75503950dd3b07b0f3983aad6a7	own_claim 4076 4158	Quadratic energy models mesh well with implicit integration’s numerical properties
T6ab7867c8e3368903b96c15db4f24c21	own_claim 4277 4419	A key step in our simulation process is the solution of an O(n) × O(n) sparse linear system, which arises from the implicit integration method
T36bb37777bddea09b065d3324b23033b	own_claim 6166 6336	Much of the performance of our system stems from the development of an implicit integration formulation that handles contact and geometric constraints in a direct fashion

T2ecc933490b3cba927edfd7bb93d267a	own_claim 7248 7387	we introduce a simple method, tailored to cloth simulation, for dynamically adapting the size of time steps over the course of a simulation
