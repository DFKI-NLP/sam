T75b6f61337b2709f54edbeeecf0d97e9	own_claim 7190 7285;7312 7406	we largely alleviate these issues with the design of the five isolated deformation measurements which allow us to separately fit stiffness curves for the six deformation components described
T02c5a510c82554cefda1e21bf1381539	own_claim 6885 7179	The nonlinearity of cloth deformation, together with the complex interplay of various deformation components in the resulting forces and positions, make the optimization problem above extremely complex in the general case, prone to falling in local minima and sensitive to initialization values
T9959d3a64d10de0432954503a2a1af9b	own_claim 3614 3661	clip-orthogonal forces are dominated by stretch
T493448164e4fccf5ecd9de24d130e5d6	own_claim 3559 3606	the clip-parallel forces are dominated by shear
