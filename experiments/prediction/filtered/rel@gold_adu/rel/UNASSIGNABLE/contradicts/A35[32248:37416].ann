Ta2be8d6f3892eacf34b48505f646acc0	own_claim 2576 2683	excessive reduction of the Conjugate Gradient iterations produce additional inaccuracy and slow convergence
T16ec1fdddf8dc913e9d1b64f4f828988	own_claim 2111 2233	Their stability gives a false sense of efficiency, allowing obtaining quickly a result by “cheating” on the time step size
T261da21511c2851fd76c1d14e40aea4a	own_claim 2435 2568	These artifacts are still augmented by the approximations made to the Hessian matrix, possibly in the purpose of reducing instability
