T02c5a510c82554cefda1e21bf1381539	own_claim 6885 7179	The nonlinearity of cloth deformation, together with the complex interplay of various deformation components in the resulting forces and positions, make the optimization problem above extremely complex in the general case, prone to falling in local minima and sensitive to initialization values
