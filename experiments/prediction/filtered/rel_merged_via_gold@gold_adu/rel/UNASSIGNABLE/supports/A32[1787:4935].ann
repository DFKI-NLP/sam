T7e313fcbd1f7f7caaf1fa613493cfbb7	background_claim 394 527	Such a large number of triangles put cloth simulation off from interactive speeds, even with adaptive time steps, introduced recently
T534588ec49fdab9a02a4c797c1948b94	background_claim 992 1087	Cloth has very large in-plane deformation stiffnesses compared to its ability to bend and shear
Ta5ac38536c3dcb914fb23357a63d5b5a	background_claim 322 392	the number of triangles required can be easily upto a hundred thousand
Tc292ab326cc258855c5ebccfda415b64	background_claim 564 644	the large triangle count increases the rendering time and the cost significantly
Tf167091fa55c08169da832de1f6149f4	background_claim 1089 1138	This gives rise to very stiff equations of motion
T2203df61fdb9058666e5c526b1ceb9de	background_claim 671 767	one can increase fineness of triangles only in the potential regions where wrinkling might occur
