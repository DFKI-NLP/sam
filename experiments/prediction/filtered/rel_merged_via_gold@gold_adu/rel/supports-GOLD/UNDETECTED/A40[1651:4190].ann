T1f3c4c8e490d2fb1a0906ee973cb0bf1	own_claim 1328 1428	we present a much simpler model based on tracing wind particles that move along a global force field
T3e2b7844a8f4ea78ae7bbe025cbc263c	own_claim 887 968	The first method is based on modelling air flows with the Navier-Stokes equations
Tcd8cbe0c81e5d3c8064110fcba7ab28f	own_claim 1142 1311	the solution of the sophisticated NavierStokes equations is not desired and not necessary in all situations where wind effects shall be integrated into cloth simulations
T924588cd84348333091c5a436143bc3c	own_claim 715 753;760 800	we discuss two different approaches to model force fields describing air motion
