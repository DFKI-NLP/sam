T6726f372b0b4ec29c9c5259759b73660	background_claim 38 169	Today’s cloth simulators for animation, visual effects, games, and apparel design can mimic real cloth to a high degree of fidelity
Te5c3c02d6414aeb976c38dc16805a6b3	background_claim 175 287	to fully exploit their capabilities, the constitutive models for cloth deformation must be tuned with great care
Tc70916d3b8cf0899751bac515b0049ad	background_claim 289 420	During this tuning process it is difficult to tell which models and which parameters are giving results more like the real material
T18abb85011b30063c1fe2d467e58e52f	own_claim 422 617	This paper aims to solve this problem by introducing new techniques to measure complete cloth behavior under controlled conditions and to estimate cloth deformation models from these measurements
T4e5f4cbb3d4d55ed1e171941272a76a8	background_claim 619 761	Most methods for testing cloth move the sample into a state of near-uniform strain, exercising one or at most two components of strain at once
Tf76a5c316ebc004e4302a6e4d4e7a749	data 763 778	pure stretching

Ta8b6224a92565d01f2cf4e066e26ecd0	background_claim 812 892	One or two forces are measured to quantify the cloth’s resistance to deformation
T368af24bc982cc8d4b595121bd8dc045	background_claim 898 995	the resulting forcedisplacement curves are valuable in studying the differences between materials
Tcc35b8420d7222e60e23afe64a21c312	background_claim 1006 1043	this approach has certain limitations
T2e3592304de9b8404850c1d0de240217	background_claim 1045 1182	The inevitable deviations from uniform strain create modeling error that cannot be quantified without knowing the actual strain variation
T1ef518db0b1cfa3d58eb91b1f562efe4	background_claim 1188 1256	force-displacement curves can be used directly to tune a cloth model

Tfa412cb26cab399343db1bc0b8e0c885	own_claim 1360 1500	a new, general system for observing cloth properties that measures more complete data than previous work in cloth capture or textile testing
T9e1dae430a75909c5883ebfb2ca8fbf6	own_claim 1514 1577	a new method for fitting parametric models to this type of data
Tfe2b6c8cd9a7081ac9ec2bcaadacca04	own_claim 1941 2028	Having deformation and force information makes our data well suited to model validation
T1c7fa20ff03860c0d841a492dc8cc79e	data 2029 2118	the experiment measures the complete answer that should be predicted by a cloth simulator
T7fc8ebf239653d51c38411ef75835fbd	own_claim 2126 2155	we do not need uniform strain
Tbcc5c42af12a20361ddafc893a4a1e2c	own_claim 2282 2441	Our approach to model estimation is to numerically optimize nonlinear stress-strain curves to minimize errors in force and position compared to the measurement
T75df6d5fc625614c28fa8917566929db	own_claim 2443 2601	We have designed a general fitting method, suited for the vast majority of existing cloth models, that leverages equilibrium conditions to guide the iteration
T12fd4582606fde35cc61411778b49681	own_claim 2603 2772	By estimating model parameters under a sequence of deformations of increasing complexity, we alleviate problems with convergence in the presence of abundant local minima
