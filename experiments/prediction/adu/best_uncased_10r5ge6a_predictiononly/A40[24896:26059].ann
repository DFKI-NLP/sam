T6c101adff63efd9828ae4b9bb05c277f	own_claim 29 118	We presented two models for including advanced wind effects into cloth simulation systems
T7eb31a945c21c53ac96dfc61ff44b649	own_claim 120 248	The first concentrates on physically accurate computations using a semi-Lagrangian approach to solve the Navier-Stokes equations
T09eef226ae3781ff8f1a7fb84fc9a0f0	own_claim 250 328	the second model incorporates a particle tracing method for global wind fields
T250c0d32e2ef144457cc35eb70942fe1	own_claim 369 481	both methods produce realistic looking results which are capable of enhancing the realism of computer animations
T8edd69e02d1914c8294e280909c08c1f	own_claim 489 538	the first model has a wider range of applications
T14d7b716d2ce90e8ece36975d18cd42d	own_claim 540 617	the second one provides an easy method which still delivers realistic effects
