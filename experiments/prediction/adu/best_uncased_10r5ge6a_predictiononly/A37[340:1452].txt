      <Abstract>Many textiles do not noticeably stretch under their own weight. Unfortunately, for better performance many cloth solvers disregard this fact. We propose a method to obtain very low strain along the warp and weft direction using Constrained Lagrangian Mechanics and a novel fast projection method. The resulting algorithm acts as a velocity filter that easily integrates into existing simulation code.</Abstract>
