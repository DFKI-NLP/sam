        In this section, we report the results of simulation parameters obtained using our technique applied to four fabrics: linen, fleece, satin and knit. We measured the mass and dimensions of the fabrics. We also accurately measure the position of the two top corners using a Vicon motion capture system. We compute the projection matrices for the camera and projector using a calibration grid comprising of several motion capture markers. We performed two trials per experiment, each with slightly different initial conditions and optimized on the first 50 frames of video in each trial. Each trial took approximately 50 hours to converge on a 2.8GHz Intel Xeon processor (approximately 600 iterations of simulated annealing). For this reason, we started the optimizations on the two trials (per fabric) with the same initial guess and chose parameters (optimized) that minimized the total error on the two trials. Static test. We perform optimization on two trials for each fabric; the results are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 . The two trials have different separation distances between the top corners. For each fabric, we optimize for six parameters: stiffness and damping parameters for stretch, shear, and bend. The air drag parameters were fixed for this experiment to the mid point of their range of values. The initial values for the two trials are obtained from a coarse exhaustive search (four values per parameter). The initial values and final values of the estimated parameters are summarized in Table 1 . Figs. 8 and 9 show a very good visual match between the simulations with their counterpart real fabrics. However, there is a significant disparity in the final optimized values from the two trials. In order to understand this disparity, we performed a set of optimizations (on a single fabric) with very similar initial values. Table 2 shows the parameter values for satin from five optimizations where the initial conditions were randomly varied by Â±5%. From the table, we see that the final error values are very close. We get consistent estimates for parameters that have lower variability (e.g., bend, stretch). Parameters with high variability are estimated poorly, because their values do not contribute sufficiently to the error. This result is consistent with our intuition that static tests cannot be used to estimate dynamic parameters like stretch and shear damping or air drag and motivates the waving test, which excites both the static and waving parameters. Waving test. We optimize for nine parameters in the waving test: the six cloth stiffness and damping parameters and three air drag parameters ( Fig. 10 ). As with the static test, we initialize the static parameters in this test from a coarse exhaustive search. The dynamic parameters were initialized using a random guess. We optimized on the first 50 frames of the sequence. The initial values and final values of the optimized parameters for two trials are reported in Table 3 . The final values of the parameters from the two trials differ in part because the variability of the parameters is still fairly high ( Fig. 11 ). Different motions or larger sequence might further reduce the variability of the parameters. We choose the parameter set that minimizes the sum of the error from the two trials. For instance, in the following example of fleece waving, we choose the parameters from experiment 2. Error: Exp 1 Error: Exp 2 Total Error Pars: Exp 1 4257.2 10913.5 15170.7 Pars: Exp 2 4566.2 7144.3 11710.5 This approach seems to produce plausible results with skirts and other validation experiments. However, we believe that a more general solution for parameter identification using our framework is to simultaneously optimize across multiple trials of different experiments. Optimization progress. Fig. 12 shows the static shape of the simulation before and after optimization. Fig. 13 shows the corresponding angle map comparison. These two figures show the progress of the optimization and indicate that the minimum corresponds to a visually compelling match. Metric validation. We compare each of the four optimized angle maps from simulation (corresponding to the four fabrics) with the four angle maps computed from video. In Fig. 14 , each curve shows one fabric (e.g., fleece) compared with four simulations, corresponding to each fabric type. We see that each fabric in simulation has a minimum error when compared to its counterpart in reality. Fig. 14 also demonstrates that our approach could be potentially useful for recognizing different types of fabrics in video. Generalization. We evaluated the parameters obtained from optimization on longer sequences (150 frames). Fig. 10 and the accompanying videos show a good visual match between corresponding frames in simulation and video. All videos are available off our web page and/or included in the DVD. The videos also show that the parameters obtained from optimization generalize well on new sequences. We also validated the estimated parameters on a long sequence actuated by a robot ( Fig. 15 ). We used a a Mitsubishi PA-10 robot arm to move the corner point along a simple sinusoidal trajectory, thereby ensuring that we had the same input motion across different fabrics. Finally, we used the optimized parameters to simulate a skipping motion of a human actor wearing a skirt ( Fig. 16 ). Here, the actor repeats the same skipping motion (approximately) for the four different skirts. We used data from a full body optical motion capture of the actor performing the same skipping motion (in another trial) to drive the character for the cloth simulation. The results show that the parameters obtained from our optimization approach approximately capture the static shape and dynamic properties of skirts of different materials.

          Figure 14: Comparing the optimized parameters in simulation for each fabric with the four real fabrics. For example, point 1 in the graph shows the error when a simulation with fleece parameters is compared with video of satin. Similarly, point 2 is the error when the satin simulation is compared with real satin. The four curves have a minimum when they are compared to their correct counterparts.
