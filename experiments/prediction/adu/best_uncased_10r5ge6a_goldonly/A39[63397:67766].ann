Tf88aca401db6cac21fe2ea4a6293bed7	data 787 937	Using the stiffness parameters in figure 1 as a reference, we ran the simulation with those bend stiffnesses multiplied by 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100 and 1,000
Tf1fcbf0d15cf32dfe84e091e58288f4a	own_claim 986 1032	The variance in the running times was under 5%
Tafa987d7a538d94e2b630111970a61d8	own_claim 1034 1123	We doubt that simulators based on explicit integration methods could make a similar claim
Tecc9ecfabcabeaf373df943cafcfd156	data 1234 1350	We ran the simulation in figure 1 with cloth resolutions of 500, 899, 2,602 (shown in figure 1 ) and 7,359 particles
T80764f7a6f5b1b366ed8b82df11069ec	data 1352 1472	The running times were, respectively, 0.23 seconds/frame, 0.46 seconds/frame, 2.23 seconds/frame, and 10.3 seconds/frame
Te588656c23b160438954bc96bc4c6f9b	own_claim 1474 1602	This is slightly better than O(n 1.5 ) performance, which is in line with the convergence rates of the conjugate gradient method
