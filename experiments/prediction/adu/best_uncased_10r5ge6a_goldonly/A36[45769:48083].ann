T44d7e763f61cd9830c11414dbf953bcd	own_claim 501 630	The combination of very complete position and force information provides an unprecedented view into the complex behavior of cloth
Tc9567d55b2005fce2804f6be218e81f8	own_claim 632 709	Our measurement setup offers very accurate control over membrane deformations

Te1798254d994c61ebc681ddb7f0e52ef	own_claim 952 1085	In order to eliminate these problems, we would like to investigate alternative ways of controlling bending deformations in the future
Tef416f3a11b32a56024a67b02329c357	own_claim 1087 1164	The data from our experiments shows some of the limitations of current models
Ta98abcb0e31d964a4deeac84e76c0876	own_claim 1166 1205	The most obvious of these is hysteresis

T5b719a72167d3873bd77a122d815f2a6	own_claim 1252 1285	cloth is clearly far from elastic
Td21c43761ca6372bf177817cda08dd38	own_claim 1287 1356	resulting in quite large errors for any given point in the experiment
T0d391cad4b37e0b9b8470d193e8f6964	own_claim 1358 1409	There are many paths for future work in measurement
