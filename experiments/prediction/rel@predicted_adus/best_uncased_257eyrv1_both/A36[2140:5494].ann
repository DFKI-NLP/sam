T6726f372b0b4ec29c9c5259759b73660	background_claim 38 169	Today’s cloth simulators for animation, visual effects, games, and apparel design can mimic real cloth to a high degree of fidelity
Te5c3c02d6414aeb976c38dc16805a6b3	background_claim 175 287	to fully exploit their capabilities, the constitutive models for cloth deformation must be tuned with great care
Tc70916d3b8cf0899751bac515b0049ad	background_claim 289 420	During this tuning process it is difficult to tell which models and which parameters are giving results more like the real material
T18abb85011b30063c1fe2d467e58e52f	own_claim 422 617	This paper aims to solve this problem by introducing new techniques to measure complete cloth behavior under controlled conditions and to estimate cloth deformation models from these measurements
T4e5f4cbb3d4d55ed1e171941272a76a8	background_claim 619 761	Most methods for testing cloth move the sample into a state of near-uniform strain, exercising one or at most two components of strain at once
